# Got this dataset from Github

#  Data from human_resources was structured into human_resources_1. 
-- and adding employee_age. Invalid dates were flagged and removed. hire_date and 
-- termination_date were standardized.
-- A final table, h_r, was created, cleaned, and deduplicated. Analyses covered gender,
-- race, age groups, locations, employment length, departments, job titles, and 
-- termination rates.
-- The result is a cleaned, structured dataset ready for business insights.

SELECT * FROM human_resources;
